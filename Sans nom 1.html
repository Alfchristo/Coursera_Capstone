# Introduction/Business Problem:</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The aim of this
project is to study the gastronomical similarities or differences
between two French cities located in opposite geographic locations,
in this case North and South, through the statistical distribution of
their restaurant venue categories. The rich cultural heritage of
France and proximity to other European states is the reason why this
geographic setting and business parameters were chosen. To study
possible gastronomic similarities, the project will base itself on
all categories of restaurants, a venue capable of expressing cultural
heritage and differences in a setting accessible to all in the cities
of Lille and Montpellier, Northern and Southern cities respectively.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The cities of Lille
and Montpellier were chosen because of their near similarities in
terms of population and area size compared to other neighbouring
major cities while factoring their administrative limits and not
their urban areas. Lille has a population of 233,098 (as of January
2018) for a city limit of 34.8km2  whereas Montpellier has a
population of 290,053 (as of January 2018) for a city limit of
56.88km2.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The resulting study
may highlight culinary interests in those wishing to travel to these
cities or further show geographic influences, if any, that can shape
a city. It can also be used for those looking to exploit where a
particular culinary venue type may be beneficial in these cities and
reduce risks of market saturation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"># Data</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In this project, the
data will rely primarily on:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">* Opendata for the
cities of
[Lille](https://opendata.lillemetropole.fr/explore/dataset/limite-des-quartiers-de-lille-et-de-ses-communes-associees/table/)
and
[Montpellier](https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/sous-quartiers-de-montpellier)
containing the geographic latitude and longitudes and name of their
neighbourhoods. In the case of Montpellier, additional manual
research had to be done to obtain geographical coordinates through
google searches because of the lack of information of it&rsquo;s
Opendata files. The manual information was then added to the cvs file
obtained from the website.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">*
[Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/city-guide) to pool together the
information of restaurants that have been registered on their
website. The reality of most actual business not registering with
Foursquare has been taking into account and thus the influence it
will have on the results of this study being more of a sample, so to
speak, of the different restaurants in these cities rather than an
accurate representation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Furthermore,
additional information on these cities has been taken from their
respective Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">[Montpellier
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier)&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">[Lille
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"># Methodology</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Lille data was
cleaned, the coordinates were split into Latitude and Longitude then
converted them from object to float type so they can be read in
folium map.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Montpellier was not
needed because done beforehand.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Data was first
collected from the free open data sources of OpenData for the
respective cities as mentioned in the previous Data section. The Data
was then cleaned and optimized so as to be ready for the successive
steps. First the geographic coordinates (Longitude/Latitude) of the
studied cities were used to illustrate the respective neighbourhoods
of the cities through the use of the
[Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) python
library. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&lt;map of cities&gt;<img src="Sans%20nom%201_html_cf10a07877ad5eec.jpg" name="Image1" align="left" width="643" height="375" border="0"/>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We will now restrict
Foursquare requests to the specific Restaurant venue type by the
CategoryId.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><img src="Sans%20nom%201_html_5205588d2460bfd1.jpg" name="Image2" align="left" width="643" height="371" border="0"/>
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">By setting up access
to the web API of Foursquare, we were then able to collect the
information necessary to compile the different restaurant venue types
by restricting searches to that specific main category. Once venues
information was collected for each neighborhood, the information was
then reviewed for possible issues such as restaurants possibly being
counted twice if the coordinates were in close proximity to being
labelled as located on the border of 2 neighborhoods thus being
counted twice and furthermore researching possible fast food
franchises.Following this the data was then further cleaned by
grouping all 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Following the venue
review, the information was then analysed through the use of the
onehot encoding approach, an approach used to &lt;DEFINITION OF HOT
ENCODING&gt; 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Following this the
data was then further cleaned by grouping all venues to their
respective neighbourhoods and then sorted by most common to least
common venue type.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&lt;top 10 most
common venues dataframe&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With the total
specific venue count, we were then able to calculate their
distribution percentages for each respective cities and chart them on
a graph to easily visualize the differences between them. Considering
the total number of venues, 47 for Lille and 38 for Montpellier, the
data was split into appropriate numbers to simplify the comparison in
their distribution.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&lt;pie charts&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We then applied a
Kmeans algorithm to study the grouping in the respective cities to be
able to learn possible patterns that may emerge and ddelve further
into the culinary tendencies of the cities. The data was used to plot
a map from the clusters and also in a dataframe. To be sure of the
Kclusters numbers, we applied the Elbow Method &lt;definition of
elbow method&gt; to reduce errors in our analysis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Once these were done
and applied, we then proceeded to the analysis of our obtained data.</p>
